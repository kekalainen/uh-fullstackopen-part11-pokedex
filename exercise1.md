# 11.1

A hypothetical SaaS web application is being worked on towards initial release by a team of six. The notable technologies used are the Laravel PHP framework for the backend, React using TypeScript for the frontend and Git for version control. This text briefly explores the main considerations relevant to continuous integration (CI), delivery and deployment (CD) for said application.

To establish a CI pipeline, one needs to combine a set of tooling for the necessary tasks. To pave the way for a smooth workflow, the team will need standardized linting, testing and building.

Linting: PHP_CodeSniffer is a popular tool for enforcing coding standards for PHP. ESLint is a similar tool in the TypeScript/JavaScript (TS/JS) world. Both allow for configurable code analysis rules which can be run both locally and on a build server and have an ecosystem with integrated development environment tooling for automatically correcting select issues. Additionally, type checking is handled at test runtime for PHP, while the TypeScript compiler (tsc) can be used for the TS source files.

Testing: Pest is a unit testing framework tailored for Laravel. It is built on the widely used PHPUnit framework, providing stable functionality with a fluent programming interface. Pest's syntax resemblant of natural language is similar to that of an equivalent tool for TS/JS called Jest. Facebook maintains both Jest and React, making them an ideal fit. End-to-end testing can be handled using Cypress as it effectively supports both languages and frameworks.

Building: As PHP is an interpreted language with optional JIT compilation the backend's source files do not need to be built into binaries ahead of time. The application code is not intended for distribution so no obfuscation or virtualization is necessary either. The React code can be transpiled into JavaScript using Babel and bundled with other assets using Webpack. Both of the tools run under Node.js.

With the tooling established, we can move on to the choice of platform. Jenkins is a seasoned self-hosted automation platform capable of running the aforementioned tools with integrations for various version control software. GitHub Actions is a newcomer covering some of the same ground for Git repositories hosted on GitHub. It is a primarily managed platform coupled with the rest of GitHub's offerings. Runners, the machines executing the pipeline, can be self-hosted when necessary while still relying on the managed coordination infrastructure. It is also possible to self-host the coordinator itself with GitHub Enterprise. GitLab provides a similar offering of CI/CD integrated with Git repositories. The licensing is less restrictive compared to that of GitHub's; it is open-source, thus less prone to vendor lock-in. However, despite the platform's earlier inception, the ecosystem is not as large.

Self-hosting entails a maintenance burden. For a team this small with no specialized compliance or hardware requirements, it is better to dedicate resources on development rather than supporting infrastructure. A managed platform is likely more cost-efficient with the requirements and scale at hand. The team should opt for a managed cloud-based environment. GitLab is a good choice, since it allows for straightforward migration to on-premises should the need arise.
